## Introduction  

Modern digital technologies have radically transformed approaches to education. Today, students and researchers have access to vast online resources, courses, and academic databases, which provide broad opportunities for self-education.  

## Main Directions of Self-Education  

1. **Online courses and lectures** – platforms such as Coursera, edX, and Stepik provide high-quality educational content across various disciplines.  
2. **Academic databases and repositories** – open resources such as arXiv and eLibrary allow access to up-to-date research.  
3. **Practical learning** – using GitHub and other platforms to publish projects and share experience.  
4. **Language learning** – digital tools accelerate the acquisition of foreign languages, essential for academic activity.  

## Advantages of Digital Self-Education  

- Flexibility and an individual pace of learning.  
- Access to global educational resources.  
- The possibility of combining learning with practical activity.  
- Development of independent search and analytical skills.  

## Limitations and Challenges  

- Information overload and the need to filter sources.  
- Lack of live interaction and discussions.  
- High demands on self-organization and discipline.  

## Conclusion  

Self-education in the digital age is becoming an integral element of academic training. It fosters critical thinking, independent knowledge acquisition, and adaptability to the rapidly changing conditions of the academic environment.
