## Introduction  

Version Control Systems (VCS) play a key role in modern software development. They enable tracking changes in code, collaborating on projects, and maintaining the integrity of software solutions.  

## Core Functions of Version Control  

1. **Change history storage** – each modification is recorded, allowing a return to previous states of the project.  
2. **Collaboration** – multiple developers can work on the same project in parallel, merging their results into a unified system.  
3. **Branch management** – the ability to create parallel development branches for experiments or new features without risking the main version.  
4. **Transparency and accountability** – every edit has an author and a comment, which facilitates code auditing.  

## Popular Version Control Systems  

- **Git** – a distributed system that has become the industry standard due to its flexibility and performance.  
- **Subversion (SVN)** – a centralized system used in large-scale corporate projects.  
- **Mercurial** – a system emphasizing simplicity and performance, also based on a distributed model.  

## Application of Git in Education  

Git is widely used by students and researchers to organize study projects and academic work. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab provide convenient tools for repository publishing, documentation, and collaborative research.  

## Conclusion  

Version control is a fundamental component of software development. It ensures reliability, transparency, and efficiency in project work, enabling both individual developers and entire teams to achieve high-quality results.
