## Introduction  

Creating a personal website has become an essential part of academic activity. An online portfolio helps to present research achievements, publications, projects, and educational background in a structured format.  

One of the convenient tools for this task is **Hugo Academic** — a theme for the Hugo static site generator designed for the academic community.  

## Key Advantages  

- Easy installation and configuration.  
- Integration with profiles from Google Scholar, ORCID, ResearchGate, and other academic platforms.  
- Ability to publish articles, blogs, and presentations.  
- Flexible structure with sections for education, projects, awards, and conferences.  
- Compatibility with modern publishing practices and version control systems.  

## Practical Application  

Hugo Academic enables students and researchers to build their own academic portfolios without deep knowledge of web development. Basic Git skills and an understanding of Markdown files are sufficient.  

A personal website can serve as a business card for conference participation, grant applications, or presenting research outcomes to a broader audience.  

## Conclusion  

A researcher’s personal website created with Hugo Academic is not only a tool for self-presentation but also a means of systematizing academic experience. This approach fosters academic career development and broadens opportunities for international collaboration.
