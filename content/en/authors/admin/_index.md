## About Me

My name is Jiang Wenzhe, and I am a first-year Computer Science student at RUDN University. At the university, I aim not only to master the fundamental disciplines but also to delve into relevant areas of computer science, including algorithms, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.

I pay special attention to programming in Python and C++, as I consider them essential tools for both practical and research-oriented tasks. I am also interested in the theoretical aspects of computer science, since they provide a solid foundation for further academic work.

Beyond my studies, I actively read articles on academic platforms, develop critical and analytical thinking, and improve my proficiency in foreign languages to participate in international projects and conferences.
